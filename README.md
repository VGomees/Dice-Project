Project for a website for the Udemy course that I’m doing, where the website is a dice game for two players, in this specific project I worked only in JavaScript.

How it works: Upon refreshing the page (F5), two random dice will be generated. If player 1’s roll is higher than player 2’s, player 1 wins. Conversely, if player 2’s roll is higher than player 1’s, player 2 wins. If both rolls are equal, it results in a draw.
